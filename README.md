# Face-Detection-System
simple computer vision system that finds and detects a personâ€™s face

**HOW WORK?**

your web camera captures the image of your face with the help of algorithms and holds it during rest, as well as movement (it should be borne in mind that with a large number of objects for detection, in our case, faces, significant computing power may be required)
